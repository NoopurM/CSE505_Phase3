This program calculates the probability of all genes being a part of the FCL DNA.

Steps followed:
1. Calculate the probabilities of genes being in the same chromosome.
2. If genes belong to the same chromosome, calculate probabilities of it being a part of the same gene chain.
3. If genes are part of the gene chain, there is a 80% chance of it being in the FCL DNA. Caluclate the probabilities of it being a part of the FCL DNA.
4. Query for all genes to check their probability of it being a part of the FCL DNA.
